  'Technical Head': {
    description: "The field of tech is vast and confusing, especially for someone new. Should I do Machine Learning or Web Dev? Should I learn Python or Java? Should I focus on Competitive Programming or building projects? What is a Hackathon and what's Open Source? Where do I start? All these question might baffle newbies, I know that as they definitely did confuse me.The key is to explore as a beginner, try a wide range of technologies and discover what you actually love doing. When it's time, dive deeper and master it. Most importantly, always stay thirsty to learn. Build strong foundations and good coding practices. In my 2nd year, I liked how visual and interactive web development was, particularly the frontend. This is how I fell in love with Web Dev and its ecosystem. With AlphaByte, I hope to connect with many of you and guide those who feel a bit lost."
